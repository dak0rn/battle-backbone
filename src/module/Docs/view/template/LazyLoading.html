	<p>
		Lazy loading makes an application faster and more modular because the client only loads resources
		when they are really required. battle-backbone provides you with two lazy loading mechanism out of the box.

			<h4>Lazy module loading</h4>
			<p>
				The <code>navigation</code> services provides you with lazy loading
				of modules where you bind a module controller to a route. The module and all of
				its dependencies will not be loaded until the route is requested.
			</p>

			<h4>Lazy resource loading</h4>
			<p>
				In addition to loading modules dynamically you can also load resources
				when a function is invoked. This allows you to write a multi-purpose controller
				that loads its resources only when they are required.

	<p>
		You usually combine these two approaches when writing modules:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Module bundles are loaded lazily using the <code>navigation</code> service and the configuration file.</li>
		<li>When the module is loaded an event will be triggered on it. The function invoked by this event will
		load the required resources.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		This allows you to write a controller that handles multiple routes (e.g. <code>login</code> and <code>logout</code>)
		but loads the resources for every route only if they are really required.
