	<p class="lead">
		This section describes how routing is implemented in battle-backbone
	</p>

	<h3 class="ln-intro"><a href="docs/router/intro" class="permalink" data-silent="true">Introduction</a></h3>

	<p>
		Routing is a complex task in an application. There are a lot of good patterns and best practices
		for routers in Backbone and Marionette. However, developers often run into problems when using
		multiple routers and complex routes.
	</p>

	<p>
		A common problem with routers is that they rely on side effects. Once instantiated, a router waits for
		the route to be changed and triggers the desired behavior. However, by default you do not have a collection
		of all routers that wait in the background. You don't even have to store router instances.
	</p>

	<p>
		battle-backbone moves the navigation from routers to the event bus. That way, you have a clean and simple
		API for route manipulation and route change handling and you do no longer have to care about complex router
		classes or invalid application routes. It even allows you to write handlers invoked when leaving a route so
		that you can fade out a view or make sure you do not produce memory leaks.
	</p>

	<h3 class="ln-terms"><a href="docs/router/terms" class="permalink" data-silent="true">Terminology</a></h3>

	<p>
		battle-backbone uses the terms <strong>language</strong>, <strong>base route</strong> and <strong>sub route</strong>.<br />
		For your current route (<code><%-vent.request('language')%>/<%-vent.request('route:full')%></code>) this is:
	</p>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-2 col-sm-push-3">
			<div class="panel panel-warning">
				<div class="panel-heading text-center"><code><%- vent.request('language') %></code></div>
				<div class="panel-body">
					Identifies the language to use in the application.<br /><br />
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="col-sm-2 col-sm-push-3">
			<div class="panel panel-success">
				<div class="panel-heading text-center"><code><%- vent.request('route') %></code></div>
				<div class="panel-body">
					First part of the route. Used to find a module that handles the route.
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="col-sm-2 col-sm-push-3">
			<div class="panel panel-primary">
				<div class="panel-heading text-center"><code><%- vent.request('route:sub') %></code></div>
				<div class="panel-body">
					<em>Route arguments</em> given to the base route handler as an array.
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		
	</div>

	<h3 class="ln-idea"><a href="docs/router/idea" class="permalink" data-silent="true">The concept</a></h3>

	<ul>
		<li>
			There is only <strong>one router</strong> that works in the background and catches all routes
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="docs/modules" class="permalink">Modules</a> are meant to handle routes. They can be bound
			to a base route using the <a href="docs/core/config" class="permalink">module configuration</a> in the configuration
			file.
		</li>
		<li>
			Modules and their resources are not loaded until the route is requested. This way, the application loads faster
			and transfers only the data that is really required. Combined with the <a href="docs/abstract/router" class="permalink">abstract Controller</a>
			it gets even more powerful.
		</li>
		<li>
			When leaving a route the currently active controller will be triggered using an event. The navigation waits for the 
			controller to finish its work (e.g. animating a view).
		</li>
		<li>
			After the module for the next route has been loaded, it will be instantiated if it has not been used before.<br />
			A handler function will be triggered in the module.
		</li>
		<li>
			The navigation service will fire an event to notify other parts of the application.
		</li>
		<li>
			Both the <a href="docs/languages" class="permalink">language</a> and the route can be changed and obtained using requests.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<div class="alert alert-success alert-inline">
		Routing is implemented in <code>src/service/navigation.<%-lang.ext%></code>
	</div>

	<h3 class="ln-requests"><a href="docs/router/requests" class="permalink" data-silent="true">Requests</a></h3>

	<p>
		Changing the language or navigating to another route is done with requests on the event bus. Requesting
		<code>navigate</code> with the new route will change the route and load the corresponding module in the background.
		<code>navigate:silent</code> can be used to change the URL without triggering events. Use <code>change:language</code>
		to update the user's language both in the URL and in the application.
	</p>

	<p>
		There are also a couple of requests that return information about the current route and the language.
	</p>

		More information about routing requests can be found in the <a href="docs/events/list" class="permalink">Events and requests</a> section.
	</div>

	<div class="alert alert-warning alert-inline">
		More information about language handling can be found in the <a href="docs/languages" class="permalink">Multi-language support</a> section.
	</div>

	<h3 class="ln-events"><a href="docs/router/events" class="permalink" data-silent="true">Events</a></h3>

	<p>
		The navigation service does not only trigger methods in the module controller
		it also fires events to notify other components.<br />
		<code>route:destroy</code> will be triggered when a route is left,
		<code>route:show</code> will be triggered after triggering a handler function
		in a module controller. Both get passed a base route and an array with sub routes.
