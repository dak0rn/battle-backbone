	<p>
		Since battle-backbone is neither a library or a framework but a toolbox that provides you with
		battle-tested best practices and common development patterns for single page applications it
		contains third-party dependencies. This page gives you a list of libraries and frameworks used
		by battle-backbone and describes reasons why they are included.

				<h4>Backbone</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-9">
				Backbone is the core framework that powers battle-backbone. We use it for our
				applications since it is small, understandable, very well documented and can be extended
				easily.
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-3">
				<h4>Marionette</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-9">
				Backbone provides only a few things and you often need complex structures like
				nested views or views that render collections. Marionette provides all this and adds
				useful components like a modularization interface and behaviors.
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-3">
				<h4>Backbone.Radio</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-9">
				Marionette comes with Backbone.Wreqr as event system. Backbone.Radio provides basically
				the same but uses a cleaner and more intuitive interface and replaces Wreqr in battle-backbone.
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-3">
				<h4>lodash</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-9">
				Backbone usually uses <a href="http://underscorejs.com">underscore</a> as utility and abstraction
				library. It has been replaced with the API-compatible lodash that provides more functionality
				and is believed to be faster in some cases.
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-3">
				<h4>jQuery</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-9">
				In addition to underscore (or lodash) Backbone needs jQuery or an API compatible library like
				zepto. We use jQuery here because it can be integrated easily and provides many things developers
				use regularily. It also has a large plugin base 
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-3">
				<h4>require.js</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-9">
				JavaScript does not provide a module system that can be used by browsers today and ES5 doesn't provide
				a module system at all. While there are a couple of module system for front-end development require.js
				provides us with bundling, plugins and dynamic loading of resources.
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-3">
				<h4>require-css</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-9">
				This plugin for require.js enables modules to load their own CSS without being forced to write
				on large centralized CSS file.
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-3">
				<h4>require.js i18n</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-9">
				This plugin makes it easy to load localization files based on the currently set language without
				the need to write complex loading logic somewhere.
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-3">
				<h4>Grunt</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-9">
				Grunt is used as task runner because it has lots of plugins, is easy to understand for new
				team members and it supports the require.js optimizer <em>r.js</em> without any hacks.<br />
				You can find more information in the <a href="docs/grunt" class="permalink">Toolchain section</a>.
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-3">
				<h4>CoffeeScript</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-9">
				Originally, battle-backbone was written in CoffeeScript because it provides a neat syntax
				that is easy to read and understandle and looks a lot less messy than JavaScript in many cases.<br />
				However, since CoffeeScript cannot be used everywhere there is also a <em>native</em> JavaScript version
				of battle-backbone that is not compiled from CoffeeScript but manually written.
