		This section describes the component structure provided by battle-backbone
	</p>

	<p>
		Just like <a href="docs/modules" class="permalink">Modules</a>, Components are a way to organize
		reusable code within your application. The main difference is a semantic one; Modules are sections
		within your application (e.g. a page), Components let you share smaller bits (e.g. a modal dialog view)
		between your modules.
	</p>

	<p>
		Technically, they work in exactly the same way as Modules with the exception that they are not bound
		to routes.
